                11. Leather goods Policy:
                <p>Natural leathers are soft and velvety. They have been tanned without altering any of their natural
                    features. This is why all the distinctive original markings stand out. This is the living proof of
                    the leather’s absolute natural origins – healed scars and scar tissues, grain variation,
                    colouration, veining and other markings which nature placed on these hides. These are all signs of
                    the inherent value of leather.
                    Payments made by EFT (Electronic funds Transfer) require a 48 hour period to clear funds and
                    allocate them to the orders.
                    Sofaworld does not accept payment by cheque because of the high risk of fraud prevalent in South
                    Africa.
                    The Sofaworld Card can be used in the Clearance Centres, but the vouchers cannot be redeemed there.
